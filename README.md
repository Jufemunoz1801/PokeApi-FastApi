# Connection to PokeApi using FastApi

before to start, remember to activate your ***venv** or ***Virtual Enviroment***
`python -m venv _venv`

in that way, all the libaries and packages will ve installed ton your ***venv*** and not on your local machine

### Install the libraries or packages
Remember install the libraries or packages that we need, on this case ***FastApi***.
you can do it quickly, on your terminal using:
`pip install fastapi`

Once the installation is done, we can start our project, but before, lets import the libraries:
`from fastapi import FastAPI`
`from pokeapi import Pokemon`

On the file ***pokeappi*** you will find the conection to the real pokeapi.
